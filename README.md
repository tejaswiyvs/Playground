Playground
==========

A repo that contains a bunch of ideas I'm currently playing with.

Any new APIs / UI controls go in here. If they turn out to be worthwhile / interesting, they get moved to a seperate repository.

Most of this is quick & dirty done to get an idea of how a particular control / API works. Not intended to be used in any production application. That said, following controls are implemented:

Timeline:
---------

A control that tries to copy the Facebook timeline view using UICollectionView.

UIKit dynamics:
---------------

???

iOS Lock Screen:
----------------

Trying to reimplement the code from one of the UIScrollView WWDC sessions.
